## General Information
- This is a personal study of a book "Spring in Action" by Craig Walls;

## Setup
* Install IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2.1;
* Install openjdk-20.0.2;
* Install PostgreSQL 15.


## Usage
* Clone this repo;
* Open the project;
* Choose a module that you'd like to run;
* In that module find the corresponding pom.xml file (this is the file with the project dependencies);
* By using the corresponding button reload the maven project;
* If the module uses a database, find the corresponding application.yaml file in that module;
* Enter the appropriate name, username, password and url;
* Run the main application class (the class annotated with @SpringBootApplication);
* If the module starts a web MVC application, you can access the application at localhost:8080;
* If the module starts a RESTful service, you can try using the request files in the resources folder.


## Project Status
The project is in progress.


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Could add docker files for each module;
- Could add JUnit tests for each module.

To do:
- Start using Spring Security;
- Start using MongoDB;
- Start using Angular.
